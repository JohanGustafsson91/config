# Redmond UI theme

An Atom UI theme for fans of the Visual Studio Blue theme.

This is a UI theme; for the complimentary syntax theme, please also download [redmond-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/redmond-syntax).

The main UI elements are mostly in-place.  Remaining significant work is colorization/icons on the tree view and squaring-off the tabs.
